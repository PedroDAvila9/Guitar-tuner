These files contain the sounds of the respective guitar strings.

## CSS
### style.css

This file contains the style definitions for the HTML page. It defines the appearance of the buttons, the style of the guitar image, and the text style.

## HTML
### index.html

This file contains the HTML structure of the page. It includes the necessary CSS and JavaScript files and defines the user interface elements such as the string buttons and the guitar image.

## JavaScript
### script.js

This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for playing the sounds of the strings when the corresponding buttons are clicked. It uses the browser's audio API to play the audio files corresponding to the guitar strings.

## How to Use

    1. Open the index.html file in a compatible web browser.

    2. Click on the buttons corresponding to the guitar strings to hear the notes and tune your guitar.

        The "e" button plays the sound of the "e" string.

        The "B" button plays the sound of the "B" string.

        The "G" button plays the sound of the "G" string.

        The "D" button plays the sound of the "D" string.

        The "A" button plays the sound of the "A" string.

        The "E" button plays the sound of the "E" string.

        Note: Each string sound will only play once, even if the button is clicked repeatedly. This is done to allow you to hear the note clearly.

        3. Adjust the strings of your guitar according to the sound played by each button.
        
        4. Repeat the process to tune all the strings of the guitar.
